# ValuB

ValuB is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that uses deep learning to classify textual data using an LSTM-based neural network. The goal of this project is to extract value-based insights from text, possibly for sentiment analysis, intent detection or other classification tasks.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow \ Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧠 Features

- Text cleaning and preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
- Label encoding and train-test splitting
- Deep learning model with LSTM for classification
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix

## 📁 Dataset

**Note**: The dataset used for this project is a large CSV file with over 50,000 labeled text samples. It includes columns for:

Text: The raw input text (e.g., reviews, statements)

Label: The classification category (e.g., sentiment, topic)

Due to its size, the dataset is not uploaded directly to GitHub. However, it can be made available on request or hosted via an external source like Google Drive or Kaggle (if permitted).

Example row format:

Text	Label
"I've shifted my focus to something else but I'm still worried"   Anxiety
"I have deadlines i cant breath from i am pushed and pushed to achieve them
"	Stress


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/valub.git
    cd valub
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the notebook:
    Open `ValuB.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells in order.

## 📊 Output

The project evaluates model performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics to show classification results.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add support for other neural network architectures (e.g., GRU, BERT)
- Create a web-based interface for real-time predictions
- Explore model explainability using SHAP or LIME
